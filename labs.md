## General

1. Is attendance mandatory for lab sessions?

    **TA Response:** No, however, it is generally recommended to go if you have time. You can get support for your questions in real-time and also network with classmates. If you want to work on the lab computers from home, once you create an EECS account, you can use <a href = "https://remotelab.eecs.yorku.ca/#/">EECS Remote Lab</a>. Please consult the <a href = "https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/dept/tdb/login:remotelabs-tips:start">RemoteLab Wiki</a> if you require additional assistance.

2. When do TA Office Hours start? 

    **TA Response:** We will begin offering TA office hours starting from the week of <b><i>September 15</i></b>. Additionally, we will offer support during reading week.

3. I missed a lab! What should I do?

    **TA Response:** We will only consider the best 8/10 labs so there should be no major issues. If you have missed more than two labs, please fill out the Accommodation Request Form. 

4. Which IDE should I use for this course?

    **TA Response:** Wing Personal is your best bet as a novice programmer. PyCharm is also fairly standard if you have programming experience. The teaching team recommends these two IDEs as they are supported on the lab machines. You can use any IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) to complete the labs.

5. Should I be using Interactive Mode or Script Mode to complete the labs?

    **TA Response:** Interactive code is convenient for testing small snippets of code. As you can imagine, it is not very good for large-scale programs; statements are not saved. Script mode is better for completing the labs as it is easier to change the code and better supports iterative development and debugging practices.

## Lab Questions & Hints

<hr>

### Lab 1 (Setup)

1. Just to clarify, what am I supposed to do/submit for the first lab?

    **TA Response:** Firstly, please navigate to: <b><i>Week 1: Introduction > Lab</i></b>. You will need to click each of the hyperlinks to complete the first two tasks; eClass automatically records your activity and gives you, "credit." Task 3 will require you to submit the relevant screenshot through eClass; you will get an e-mail confirming your submission.

2. I am using PyCharm but I cannot access interactive mode! Please help!

    **TA Response:** You should see a Python emblem near the bottom left corner of the IDE; clicking this will enable Interactive Mode. If you do not see the emblem, then please:
      - Click the, "â˜°" icon in the top left corner of your IDE.
      - Hover over, "View" and select Tool Windows > Python Console.
