| Demo | Explanation |
| ----- | ----- |
| Unit Testing | Provides solutions to the Week 4 Recitation questions discussed in the in-person lab session. This demo provides students with hands-on examples of how to follow the function design recipe and write docttest / unittests. While the course will not require students to write unit tests, it is still discussed so that the learning curve to understand JUnit in LE/EECS 1022 and LE/EECS 2030 is trivial. |
| Local/Global Variables and Functions (Cont.) | Provides solutions to the Week 5 Recitation questions discussed in the in-person lab session. This demo provides students with writing programs that use global variables. Recursion is briefly discussed and gently introduced through the application of code examples. Lastly, students are provided with examples of proper Unit Testing which will be a required skill in Lab 5. |
| Regular Expressions | Introduces students to regular expressions (re); a more effective way to search for / replace patterns in a string. **Please note that you are not required to understand and/or use regular expressions in this course.** The tutorial provides you with an alternative approach to relying on chaining string methods together. You will learn more about them next year in LE/EECS 2001! :)|
| Modules | Introduces students to modules (or, libraries) and how to use their corresponding names (functions, variables). Students are also encouraged to explore third-party modules with pip or conda. Do not worry about how external.py works; it is somewhat out of the scope of this course. You will learn about Generators in LE/EECS 2030 and LE/EECS 2101!|
| Control Flow | Introduces students to control flow (if-elif-else, for, while) and how to use their corresponding keywords (pass, continue, break). Students are also introduced to fizzBuzz, binary search, and time complexity. As an additional recitation, students installed pyflowchart and generated a flowchart for fizzBuzz from the command line. |
| Collections I | Introduces students to tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries. Students are also exposed to problems which require these data structures to solve; twoSum and validParentheses. |
| Collections II | Introduces students to *args and **kwargs for variable-length function parameters. Looping through collections via elements, indexes, and list comprehension are also reviewed from last week. Constructors are briefly discussed in terms of converting between different data types (iterables). Lastly, students are introduced to the notion of references, shallow, and deep copies. |
| Collections III | Introduces students to nested collections and iteration techniques (by index or alias). Time complexity is briefly discussed and good common software engineering practices are summarized. The Collection Memory Model is reviewed with another demo. Lastly, students are challenged with two homework problems. Solutions are provided in the recitations accompanying Jupyter Notebook. |
