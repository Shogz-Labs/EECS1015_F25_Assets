| Demo | Explanation |
| ----- | ----- |
| Unit Testing | Provides solutions to the Week 4 Recitation questions discussed in the in-person lab session. This demo provides students with hands-on examples of how to follow the function design recipe and write docttest / unittests. While the course will not require students to write unit tests, it is still discussed so that the learning curve to understand JUnit in LE/EECS 1022 and LE/EECS 2030 is trivial. |
| Local/Global Variables and Functions (Cont.) | Provides solutions to the Week 5 Recitation questions discussed in the in-person lab session. This demo provides students with writing programs that use global variables. Recursion is briefly discussed and gently introduced through the application of code examples. Lastly, students are provided with examples of proper Unit Testing which will be a required skill in Lab 5. |
| Regular Expressions | Introduces students to regular expressions (re); a more effective way to search for / replace patterns in a string. **Please note that you are not required to understand and/or use regular expressions in this course.** The tutorial provides you with an alternative approach to relying on chaining string methods together. You will learn more about them next year in LE/EECS 2001! :)|
