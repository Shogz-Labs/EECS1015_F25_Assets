| Week 1: Course Introduction | We briefly discussed the introductory content from the first lecture and touched on the different areas of computer science. The lab deliverables were discussed and a Q&A period was held to address student concerns. | N/A |
| Week 2: Basic Building Blocks | We briefly discussed how to write simple scripts with literals, operators, expressions, and variables. Students were reminded of how to find what a method does via documentation and how to debug with breakpoints. A very simple case study was demonstrated in the live environment. | N/A |
| Week 3: Basic Building Blocks II | We briefly reviewed the common built-in string methods and discussed boolean logic (LE/EECS 1019). Logical equivalences were briefly discussed with examples from truth tables. | N/A |
| Week 4: Functions | We briefly discussed Python string formatting techniques and how to follow the function design recipe. Test-Driven Development is briefly discussed and students are provided with examples of how to write proper doctests and unittests.| [Lecture_4_UnitTest_Examples.ipynb](https://github.com/Shogz-Labs/EECS1015_F25_Assets/blob/main/ta_recitations/Demos/Lecture_4_UnitTest_Examples.ipynb) |
| Week 5: Functions (Cont.) | We briefly discussed how to write programs with variable scope in mind (wrt Functions). Following this, Recursion is briefly discussed and students are given three sample problems. | [Lecture_5_Functions.ipynb](https://github.com/Shogz-Labs/EECS1015_F25_Assets/blob/main/ta_recitations/Demos/Lecture_5_Functions.ipynb) |
| Week 6: Reading Week | Work hard, play hard; good luck with everything ðŸ«¡. Come by Office Hours if you have any questions!| N/A |
| Week 7: Functions (Cont.) | We briefly discussed how to import modules and find their documentation and names in interactive mode. Following this, positional, keyword, and default arguments are summarized from the weekly lecture. | [Lecture_6_Modules.ipynb](https://github.com/Shogz-Labs/EECS1015_F25_Assets/blob/main/ta_recitations/Demos/Lecture_6_Modules.ipynb) |
| Week 8: Control Flow | We briefly discussed control flow through visual examples and LeetCode Easy questions. Programming style was discussed so that students avoid unnecessary nesting and expensive calls. | [Lecture_7_ControlFlow.ipynb](https://github.com/Shogz-Labs/EECS1015_F25_Assets/blob/main/ta_recitations/Demos/Lecture_7_ControlFlow.ipynb), [Control Flow Visualizer (pyflowchart)](https://github.com/Shogz-Labs/EECS1015_F25_Assets/tree/main/ta_recitations/Demos/Control%20Flow%20Visualizer%20(pyflowchart)) |
