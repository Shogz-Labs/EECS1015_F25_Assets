| Week 1: Course Introduction | We briefly discussed the introductory content from the first lecture and touched on the different areas of computer science. The lab deliverables were discussed and a Q&A period was held to address student concerns. | N/A |
| Week 2: Basic Building Blocks | We briefly discussed how to write simple scripts with literals, operators, expressions, and variables. Students were reminded of how to find what a method does via documentation and how to debug with breakpoints. A very simple case study was demonstrated in the live environment. | N/A |
| Week 3: Basic Building Blocks II | We briefly reviewed the common built-in string methods and discussed boolean logic (LE/EECS 1019). Logical equivalences were briefly discussed with examples from truth tables. | N/A |
| Week 4: Functions | We briefly discussed Python string formatting techniques and how to follow the function design recipe. Test-Driven Development is briefly discussed and students are provided with examples of how to write proper doctests and unittests.| [Lecture_4_UnitTest_Examples.ipynb](https://github.com/Shogz-Labs/EECS1015_F25_Assets/blob/main/ta_recitations/Demos/Lecture_4_UnitTest_Examples.ipynb) |
